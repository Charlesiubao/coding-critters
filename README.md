# Coding Critters

## What's it all about?

    Coding is now considered a must-have skill. If We believe that the children are our future,
    then this game is where to start.

    This is for Ronald, my little boy.

### How does it work?

    Coding Critters is a multiple choice trivia game that focuses on topics learned from week 1.
    Throughout the game we will be guided by our very own mascott, Patty the Panda.

### Dynamics:

    The game will feature some type of map where the player can click around icons
    and NPC that will then prompt a window where that NPC will provide
    a question hard coded into the character.
    Player can then pick the correct answer out of 4 choices provided.
    The correct answer is hard coded in the choices.

### What I used to make this game and intended features:

    I will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript
    I will use DOM manipulation to move about the map, instead of an anchor tag that will take me
    to a completely new page. The addition of event listeners within the game and the page will be
    a feature as well. I intend to add a mute button for quiet playtime, at least in the future.
    To win, I will add a timer.
    If the player gets all the right answers before time runs out, they win. if not, they get to try again.
