# Coding Critters

## What's it all about?

    Coding is now considered a must have skill. If We believe that the children are our future,
    then this game is where to start.

    This is for Ronald, my little boy.

### How does it work?

    Programming Patty is a multiple choice trivia game that focuses on topics learned from week 1.
    Throughout the game we will be guided by our very own mascott, Patty the Panda.

### Dynamics:

    The game will feature some type of map where the player can click around icons
    and NPC that will then prompt a window where that NPC will provide
    a question from a pre-made array or API.
    Player can then pick the correct answer out of 4 choices provided,
    by clicking, and event listener that will be a feature.
    Both Player and NPC will have some kind point value assigned using class object
    function. Each NPC will allow one mistake, and if player gets the answer wrong the second time, the event with that NPC will restart.

### What I used to make this game and intended features:

    I will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript
    I will use DOM manipulation to move about the map, instead of an anchor tag that will take me
    to a completely new page. The addition of event listeners within the game and the page will be
    a feature as well. I intend to add a mute button for quiet playtime.
    Each NPC can have some represented value that every correct answer a player gets
    will make the NPC's represented value, drop. I will achieve this by using class objects.
    Similarly, the player will have some representative value that will decrease when providing wrong answers.
